# vuefolio

My first foray into Vue.js

## Planning

## To-do:

- List out components
- Figure out tabbing using dynamic components and the is prop
- ~~Create JSON file with project info~~
-

## Thoughts

- Does ProjectView.vue do too much in one component?
- Wasn't able to load locally hosted images through the JSON file
